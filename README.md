# IrisMQ Book

IrisMQ is a microservices architecture that combines [NSQ](http://nsq.io) and [Project Iris](https://github.com/ibmendoza/project-iris) to stop API sprawl and use the programming language you want (as long as it supports NSQ and Iris protocols) however you want. Bring your own libraries, modules, packages, you name it.

To quote [Jesper Louis Andersen](https://medium.com/this-is-not-a-monad-tutorial/interview-with-jesper-louis-andersen-about-erlang-haskell-ocaml-go-idris-the-jvm-software-and-b0de06440fbd#),

> Protocols are far better than APIs because they invite multiple competing implementations of the same thing. They debug themselves over time by virtue of non-interaction between peers. And they open up the design space, rather than closing it down. In a distributed world, we should not be slaves to API designs by large mega-corporations, but be masters of the protocols.
